## Evergreen v7 Migration guide

Evergreen v7 [migration guide](https://evergreen.segment.com/introduction/migrations)

## Install and use components

üå≤ Evergreen is made up of multiple components and tools which you can import one by one. All you need to do is install the `evergreen-ui` package:

```sh
$ yarn add evergreen-ui
# or
$ npm install --save evergreen-ui
```

A working version, assuming you are using something like [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), might look like this:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { Button } from 'evergreen-ui'

ReactDOM.render(<Button>I am using üå≤ Evergreen!</Button>, document.getElementById('root'))
```

## Core values of üå≤ Evergreen

- **Evergreen is built on the belief that you can never predict all future requirements,
  only prepare for it.** Instead of creating fixed configurations that work today, Evergreen promotes building systems that anticipate new and changing design requirements.

- **Evergreen is built on the belief that things should work out of the box with smart defaults, but also offer full control when needed.** For example, Evergreen uses CSS-in-JS and builds on top of the Box component in [ui-box](https://github.com/segmentio/ui-box).

- **Evergreen is built on the belief that using Evergreen and contributing to Evergreen should be a pleasant experience.** We prioritize documentation and all the tools for a solid developer experience. We advocate respect and inclusivity in our writings and interactions.

## FAQ

### Theming support?

Evergreen supports a robust theming layer out of the box. You can check out [these docs](https://evergreen.segment.com/introduction/theming) for more information regarding theming in Evergreen.

### How does Server Side Rendering (SSR) work?

Evergreen offers easy Server Side Rendering (SSR) and automatic hydration.

Evergreen bundles its own CSS-in-JS solution from [ui-box](https://github.com/segmentio/ui-box). To make it super easy to do server side rendering and hydration, Evergreen exposes a `extractStyles()` function.
