## Introduction

Evergreen uses the amazing [@blueprintjs/icons](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#icons) package for all of its icons.

## Implementation Details

The `Icon` component is almost identical to the `Icon` component found in BlueprintsJS.
The exception is that BlueprintJS is using TypeScript.

### Icons are not buttons

A icon is only a `svg` element and should not have `onClick` handlers.
If you need a clickable icon, use `IconButton` instead.

## Basic icon usage

```jsx
<CrossIcon />
```

## Backwards-compatible icon usage

```jsx
<Icon icon="cross" />
```

## Tree Shaking

Due to existing support for IconButton and Icon to pass in icon strings we can't always get tree shaking for icons (which drastically can reduce the bundle size),
but it is possible to import icons directly â€“ and is in fact the recommended way to use icons.

```jsx
<CrossIcon />
```

## Resizing the icon

```jsx
<BanCircleIcon size={40} />
```

## Changing the color

Use the `color` prop on a `Icon` component to change the color.
There are a couple of presets available: `default`, `muted`, `disabled`, `selected`, `success`, `info`, `danger`, `warning`.

```jsx
<Pane>
  <BanCircleIcon color="danger" marginRight={16} />
  <TickCircleIcon color="success" marginRight={16} />
  <WarningSignIcon color="warning" marginRight={16} />
  <InfoSignIcon color="info" marginRight={16} />
  <EditIcon color="muted" marginRight={16} />
  <EditIcon color="selected" marginRight={16} />
  <EditIcon color="disabled" marginRight={16} />
</Pane>
```



## All icons

Each icon has two different `svg` variations, a `16px` and `20px` variation.
Evergreen will choose the most appropriate size based on the `size` passed to the icon.

<IconSearch />

<PropsTable of="Icon" />
