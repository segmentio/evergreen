import PropsTable from 'components/PropsTable'

## Introduction

The `Portal` component is a utility component to help with the `ReactDOM.createPortal` API.
[Learn more about portal on the official React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html)

Portals are used throughout Evergreen in components such as `Overlay` and `Positioner` to provide
a robust way of rendering outside of the current DOM tree.

## Example

```jsx
<Portal>
  <Pane background="red" padding={24} position="fixed" bottom={0}>
    <Text color="white">Look ma, I am in a portal!</Text>
  </Pane>
</Portal>
```

<PropsTable of="Portal" />
