## Evergreen v6 Migration Guide

Evergreen v6 is one of the biggest releases of Evergreen yet. We've spent a lot of timing thinking about how to let consumers extend Evergreen,
and as a result have made quite a few changes to how you might use it. Please follow the guide below, and reach out via GitHub Issues if there's anything
that you're seeing that we might have missed!

### Breaking Changes

- [No more `css` prop on `<Pane />` or `<Text />`](#css-prop)
- [No more `hasTrim` prop on `<Alert />`](#has-trim)

#### No more `css` prop {#css-prop}

Previously, `<Pane />` and `<Text />` had a `css` prop, which allowed consumers to write arbitrary css styles (including composing pseudoselectors) and pass those
through to the underlying `<Pane />` and `<Text />` components.

With this removed, we encourage either using the standard Evergreen components directly, or taking a CSS-in-JS route to adding those styles (via className for instance).

```diff static
 const MyComponent = () => {
-  return <Pane css={ {':hover': { backgroundColor: 'red' }}} />
+  return <Pane className={backgroundRedClass} />
 }
```

#### No more `hasTrim` prop on `<Alert />` {#has-trim}

Previously, `<Alert />` had a `hasTrim` boolean prop to control the left border appearance (which was provided by default). Now you can override this directly through props or via theming instead, if you so choose:

```diff static
-<Alert hasTrim={false} />
+<Alert border="none" />
```
