## Evergreen V5 Migration Guide

Evergreen V5 is a general health check for the framework. We took a look at what makes Evergreen tick
and compared it to new standards. We made several updates to try and push the DevX of using the framework
to be a lot more natural and robust. Below you can see some of the changes we made that may require some
work on your side to to upgrade to v5.

### Breaking Changes

 - [innerRef is gone. Use ref](#refs)
 - [Popover triggers](#popovers)
 - [Importing and using Icons](#icons)
 - [Downshift v5](#downshift)

### innerRef no longer supported {#refs}

Previous versions of `ui-box` and Evergreen relied on passing around `innerRef` props to forward refs to the underlying components.
We've centralized on the standard way of using refs in React: passing a `ref` directly on the component. Almost all Evergreen components
support forwarding refs.

Note: If you find a component that you think should be forwarding refs and isn't, please open an issue on GitHub!

Here's an example of how to update your code:

```diff static
 const MyComponent = () => {
   const inputRef = React.useRef()
-  return <TextInput innerRef={inputRef} />
+  return <TextInput ref={inputRef} />
 }
```

### Popover triggers {#popovers}
With the removal of `innerRef` in Evergreen, there are some potential changes required with implementations of `Popover`.
The direct `child` of a `Popover` **must be** a component that can forward refs to a DOM node. If you are using class components,
you'll need to update your code. We've found the easiest path is to use an Evergreen component – which already handle ref forwarding.
You can see an example below:

```diff static
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Popover content={(<Heading size={400} padding={16}>Example Popover</Heading>)}
+     <Pane display="inline-flex">
        <MyClassComponent />
+     </Pane>
    </Popover>
  )
}
```

We recommend using `Button` or `IconButton` as the trigger, because it provides better accessibility:

```diff static
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Popover content={(<Heading size={400} padding={16}>Example Popover</Heading>)}
-     <MyClassComponent />
+     <Button>Click me!</Button>
    </Popover>
  )
}
```

### Importing and using Icons {#icons}

Previously, the way we shipped icons in `evergreen-ui@^4` would significantly bloat bundle sizes. Even if you only
used 1 icon from Evergreen, you would ship all 400+ icons to your end-users.

In `evergreen-ui@^4.26.0` we introduced a new way to import icons that would lead to _some amount_ of tree-shaking.

Finally, in `evergreen-ui@^5.0.0` we have full tree-shaking support. This does impact the way you import icons (`import { Icon } from 'evergreen-ui'`) and pass
icons as props to other components like `Button`, `IconButton`, `Menu.Item`, `OrderedList` (and `Ol`), `UnorderedList` (and `Ul`).

We updated all the components that internally were using the `Icon` component and updated the prop to no longer expect a string but a React node.
We also removed the `Icon` component from Evergreen itself. This means that all places you were using this component, you will need to
update to use the new exported icons.

There is also a codemod that can help you with this migration. It can be installed and used from the `codemods` directory. Notably it only
updates `import { Icon } from 'evergreen-ui'`.

```sh static
npx jscodeshift -t node_modules/evergreen-ui/codemods/4.25.0-4.26.0/replace-icon-imports.js --parser=tsx --extensions=js,ts,tsx <your file target> --dry --print
```

#### Migration path

Importing an icon:

```diff static
- import { Icon } from 'evergreen-ui'
+ import { CogIcon } from 'evergreen-ui'
 
- <Icon icon="cog" />
+ <CogIcon />
```

Passing an icon as a prop:

```diff static
- import { Button } from 'evergreen-ui'
+ import { Button, CogIcon } from 'evergreen-ui'
 
- <Button iconBefore="cog">
+ <Button iconBefore={<CogIcon />}>
    Settings
  </Button>
```

### Downshift v5 {#downshift}

We upgraded the version of Downshift we use internally in Evergreen from version `3.3.1` to `5.2.0`. As part of this some
component props have been deprecated and are no longer available in the components that use Downshift.
See the [diff in #792](https://github.com/segmentio/evergreen/pull/792).

#### Components affected
 - `AutoComplete`
 - `Combobox`

#### Props removed
 - `defaultSelectedItem` - use `initialSelectedItem`
 - `defaultInputValue` - use `initialInputValue`
 - `getButtonProps` - use `getToggleButtonProps`
