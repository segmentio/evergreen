# Introduction

The color system for a product has many requirements and constraints.
There is a need to be intentional and functional with color use. Although the Evergreen color system has a bit of overlap with the Segment brand.
There are also many other colors not found in the Segment brand.

# Design Values

- **Intentional:** use colors in a functional way to show intent when needed.
- **Accessible:** use colors with as much contrast as possible while still being beautiful. Break this rule for the green brand color. Prevent muddy neutral colors.
- **High Dynamic Range:** use very light neutral colors for background colors. Allow for a wide range of the color spectrum.

# Implementation Details

The color system in Evergreen is located in the theme and is used throughout components in the theme. It is tokenized and scaled, typically from 100-500, with
shades of blue and gray (our primary and neutral colors) needing more scales to be wholly expressive.
