# Introduction

The color system for a product has many requirements and constraints.
There is a need to be intentional and functional with color use. Although the Evergreen color system has a bit of overlap with the Segment brand.
There are also many other colors not found in the Segment brand.

# Design Values

- **Intentional:** use colors in a functional way to show intent when needed.
- **Accessible:** use colors with as much contrast as possible while still being beautiful. Break this rule for the green brand color. Prevent muddy neutral colors.
- **High Dynamic Range:** use very light neutral colors for background colors. Allow for a wide range of the color spectrum.

# Implementation Details

The color system in Evergreen is located in the theme and is used throughout the theme.
There is no real dependency on any of the colors directly within components.
Components always access a theme color or property through a get function. For example, `theme.getTextColor` is a required function in the Evergreen theme, theme.colors is not a required property.
