# Usage

The Portal component is a utility component to help with the `ReactDOM.createPortal` API.
Learn more about portal on the [official React docs.](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) <br />
Portals are used throughout Evergreen in components such as [Overlay](./overlay) and [Positioner](./positioner) to provide
a robust way of rendering outside of the current DOM tree.

## Example

```jsx
<Portal>
  <Pane background="red" padding={24} position="fixed" bottom={0} right={0}>
    <Text color="white">Look ma, I am in a portal!</Text>
  </Pane>
</Portal>
```
